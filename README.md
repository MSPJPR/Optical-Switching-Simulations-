Objective:

The project simulates the concepts of optical switching, packet switching, and burst switching using an interactive web-based platform. It aims to visualize the dynamic processes of network nodes, packet generation, routing, and metrics calculation in optical networks.

Features:

1. Interactive Network Management:

Add and remove network nodes dynamically.

Simulate packet generation and routing between nodes.



2. Real-Time Metrics Display:

Tracks and displays:

Packets generated.

Network latency (ms).

Network throughput (Mbps).




3. Dynamic Visualization:

Nodes are positioned in a circular layout for better visualization.

Connections are displayed dynamically to show packet routing paths.



4. Randomized Metrics:

Each packet generation simulates random latency and throughput values to emulate real-world network variability.




Technologies Used:

Frontend:

HTML for structure.

CSS for styling and visual enhancements.

JavaScript for interactivity and simulation logic.



File Structure:

1. index.html:

The main HTML file that provides the structure of the application.



2. style.css:

Adds a professional look with interactive styles for nodes, buttons, and metrics display.



3. script.js:

Implements the core logic for node management, packet routing, and metrics updates.

Outcome:

This project provides an intuitive way to understand the mechanisms of optical switching and packet switching, showcasing key concepts in a visually engaging and interactive manner.
